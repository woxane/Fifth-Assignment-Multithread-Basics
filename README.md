## Introduction 👋

Welcome to your Sixth Advanced Programming (AP) journey, where you'll delve into the fascinating world of multithreading in Java. This project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Theoretical Questions**: This section is designed to deepen your understanding of key multithreading concepts in Java. You'll explore topics such as the `Runnable` interface, the `Thread` class, the `interrupt()` method, and the `run()` method, and engage with thought-provoking questions that challenge your theoretical knowledge.

2. **Practical Questions**: In this section, you'll get hands-on experience with multithreading in Java. You'll have the opportunity to write code that implements the theoretical concepts you've learned, providing you with practical understanding and experience.

Prepare to navigate the dynamic landscape of concurrent programming and emerge with a deeper appreciation for the power and potential of multithreading in Java. We wish you an enlightening and enjoyable journey!

## Prerequisites ✅

Before embarking on the journey of multithreading in Java, make sure you have the following tools installed on your programming workstation:

### Tools Needed:
- **Java 17 or higher** : Download the latest version from [Oracle's Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
- **Git** : Install Git, a powerful version control system, from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Gradle** : Utilize Gradle (recommended version 7.6 or newer) as the build tool. You can find installation instructions [here](https://gradle.org/install/).

## Objectives 🎯

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Deepen your understanding of **multithreading** in Java and apply the concepts effectively.
- Gain familiarity with key multithreading concepts such as the `Runnable` interface, the `Thread` class, the `interrupt()` method, and the `run()` method.
- Enhance your skills in designing robust and efficient multithreaded applications.
- Learn to manage and track changes in your project using Git.
- Develop problem-solving skills by tackling theoretical and practical questions related to multithreading.

Please note that while this assignment covers many important aspects of multithreading, there are some advanced topics such as race condition, synchronization, and others that won't be covered in this assignment and will be introduced in the following week. However, a solid understanding of the concepts covered in this assignment is crucial for grasping those advanced topics.

## Tasks 📋

### Theoretical Questions 📝 

1. **What is the behavior of a sleeping thread in Java when its interruption flag is checked from within the thread itself?**
    - *Hint*: Consider the role of the `InterruptedException` and the `Thread.interrupted()` method.
```java
public class SleepThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(10000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread was interrupted!");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SleepThread thread = new SleepThread();
        thread.start();
        thread.interrupt();
    }
}
```
2. **In Java, what would be the outcome if the `run()` method of a `Runnable` object is invoked directly, without initiating it inside a `Thread` object?**
    - *Hint*: Think about the difference between calling a method directly and starting a new thread.
```java
public class DirectRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DirectRunnable runnable = new DirectRunnable();
        runnable.run();
    }
}
```
3. **Could you elaborate on the sequence of events that occur when the `join()` method of a thread (let's call it `Thread_0`) is invoked within the `Main()` method of a Java program?**
    - *Hint*: Reflect on the purpose of the `join()` method and how it affects the execution of the `Main()` thread.
```java
public class JoinThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JoinThread thread = new JoinThread();
        thread.start();
        try {
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Back to: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

### Practical Questions 💻

1. **Task Scheduler**:

   - In this problem, you are given an **ArrayList** of tasks, each with two fields: **taskName** and **processingTime**. The goal is to sort these tasks based on their priority, where tasks with longer processing times have higher priority. After sorting, we’ll create separate threads for each task and execute them. Importantly, we’ll wait for each thread to finish its work to ensure the desired execution order. Finally, we’ll return the order of task execution.

2. **Parallelizing Matrix Multiplication**:

   - In this problem, you are asked to write a program that can parallelize matrix multiplication using multithreading.

   - In the **ParallelizeMatMul** method, you will be given two matrices, **A** and **B**. Matrix **A** has dimensions **p** × **q**, and matrix **B** has dimensions **q** × **r** (where both **p** and **r** are even numbers). Your task is to compute the dot product of matrices **A** and **B** to obtain a resulting matrix, **C**. To achieve faster execution, we’ll utilize multithreading.

   - **Hint**:

     - Divide the final matrix **C** into four equal quarters, as shown in the figure below. Assign each quarter to a separate thread for calculations.

     - Procedure:
       1. Divide the quarters among four threads in the **ParallelizeMatMul** method.
       2. Specify how each thread should calculate the elements in its assigned quarter within its **run()** method.
       3. Store the calculated elements from each thread in temporary matrices.
       4. Combine the temporary matrices to construct the final matrix **C**.

## Evaluation ⚖️

Your work on this assignment will be evaluated based on:

- **Understanding of Multithreading Concepts**: Your ability to accurately answer the theoretical questions, demonstrating a deep understanding of multithreading in Java. Please note that the answers to the theoretical questions should be provided separately from the report.

- **Code Quality**: Your code should be well-structured, readable, and efficient. Proper use of Java conventions, including variable naming, class structure, and comments, will also be considered.

- **Report**: A well-written report detailing the tasks completed, the challenges faced, and the solutions implemented. This should include clear explanations of your answers to the practical questions.
